			Welcome to <b>WooperIsBest.GitHub.io!</b> This site is my personal repo for many of my programming projects over my years. It tells the story of my evolution as a programer,
			starting from when I began dabbling with Web languages (HTML, CSS, JS) and continuing to the present day.<br><br>
			While the early projects are arguably very messy and simple (I was self-taught after all), later on my coding style and technique developed, allowing for bigger and
			more complicated projects. If you happen to be here to see my portfolio (perhaps this is a future job opportunity?), I would recommend focusing on more recent projects.
			Otherwise, it will hopefully be fun to look through a variety of projects and see how I've improved!

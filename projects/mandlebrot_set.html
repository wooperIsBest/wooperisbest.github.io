			This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandlebrot Set</a> renderer was one of my first graphical projects with C++
			(Ironically, it does pretty much nothing that couldn't been done just as easily with C, but ah, well).<br><br>
			
			The actual coding aspect of this project is admittedly not too complex, but it was fun to work out the math behind the complex numbers.<br><br>
			
			The program can be controlled with W to zoom in and arrow keys to pan directionally.

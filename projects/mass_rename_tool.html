			The <b>Mass Rename Tool</b> is a useful tool for large datasets. It simply takes all the files in the current directory in the order
            they are currently in and renames them according to the user's input and a following number. While this is, at least personally,
            rarely a necessary task, in such situations that put forth this requirement it this tool is much faster than manually renaming the files.
            One time I used it was taking an image that I had split into many tiles and renaming each of those tile files sequentially.

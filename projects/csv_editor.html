				Sample inputs and outputs for<br>the CSV Editor.
			</div>
			This basic CSV editor was, believe it or not, a result of me snooping around on my school computer's files and finding these mysterious ".csv" files.
            After thoroughly investigating them (with my high-tech editor, Notepad), I realized that the format was extremely simple (in fact, just comma separated),
			and that even I could likely write an interface for editing them.

			<hr>
			Input.py is a small Python module I developed, mostly for my own sanity. When getting into larger Python projects, it was becoming increasingly annoying to have to write
			input validation each time user input was needed.<br><br>
			
			This module includes several functions: <code>int_input</code>, <code>float_input</code>, and <code>choice</code>. The first two repeatedly ask the user for an int or 
			float, respectively, until a valid one is given, while the third asks for a string out of a certain list.<br><br>
			
			This also introduced me to <code>import</code>ing my own Python modules into other programs.

				Sample inputs and outputs for<br>the calculator program.
			</div>
			This was my final project for my sophomore CS Principles class. We had the opportunity to choose any program to develop, so long as it fulfilled several requirements,
			so naturally my partner and I decided to try something significantly more complicated than necessary.<br><br>
			
			Essentially, this python program serves as a text parser for mathematical equations. While the Python shell has these capabilities (and more) by itself, we thought
			it would be fun to figure out roughly how that parsing worked.<br><br>
			We added a good amount of functionality for its purpose, including basic arithmetic, order of operations (also supporting parenthesis), trigonometry, and several constants.<br><br>
			
			Throughout this project, we learned about tokenizing / lexical analysis and significantly deepened our understanding of recursion, a technique we made extensive use of
			when executing statements.

				My progress on the Advent of Code challenge.<br>
			</div>
			
			This year, I decided to participate in the <b><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2024">Advent of Code</a></b> challenge in Python. While I was unable to figure
			out every challenge, particularly the later, more difficult ones, I did learn a few key things while working on solutions.<br>
			<ul>
				<li>First, I gained an understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">bit arrays</a>, and used them as a compact method of storing
				sets of boolean data (see my implementation, <a href="../src/py/advent-of-code-2024/bitboard.py">bitboard.py</a>).</li>
				<li>Additionally, I made an implementation of the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure/">graph data structure</a> to assist in
				solving the challenges, including an implementation of the depth-first search algorithm. On the backend, my implmentation uses the bit array I created
				to efficiently store edge relations, both directed and undirected (see <a href="../src/py/advent-of-code-2024/graph.py">graph.py</a>).</li>
				<li>Finally, I created a <a href="../src/py/advent-of-code-2024/grid.py">grid</a> implementation to work with more familiar x and y coordinates in a
				definite space.</li>
			</ul>
			Using these tools, I was able to solve some of the challenges. This helped me keep my problem-solving brain engaged in relatively small projects, ideal for
			this time where I was busy with schooling and extracurriculars.

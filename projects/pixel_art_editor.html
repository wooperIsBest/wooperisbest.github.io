			The <b>Pixel Art Editor</b> has the functionalities of a basic drawing program. Users can use several tools (the pencil, eraser, fill bucket, dropper, and line tool)
			to create drawings. This is also my first program to support a resizable window, and thus also supports scrolling the canvas when it is too large for the window.<br><br>
			
			This project helped me learn a ton about several areas of computing. One of these things that I really enjoyed was figuring out line rasterization. I developed an
			algorithm that determined the equation of the line, then essentially rounded to the nearest pixel at each given input. I also decided to include the SDL2_image library,
			so I had to actually learn about the <code>-I</code>, <code>-L</code>, and <code>-l</code> compiler flags. Finally, I made the program scalable to the window size, which
			was quite a bit of effort but helped me understand certain methods I could use to do so.<br><br>

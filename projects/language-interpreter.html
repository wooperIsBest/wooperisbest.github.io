				Sample inputs and outputs for<br>the language interpreter.
			</div>
			This was my third attempt, in a row, at making a programming language (with the first two, I had no idea what I was doing). It uses a simple grammar based mostly
			on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>, with some slightly different functions. Its capabilties include:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>A basic I/O shell, where each command is run as the user inputs it</li>
				<li>Program memory, stored when the user types a line number before the command</li>
				<li>The ability to write to program memory from a file</li>
				<li>Several basic commands, including variables, <code>INPUT</code>, <code>IF</code> statements, and <code>GOTO</code> numbers</li>
				<li>A rudimentary error message system</li>
			</ul>
			The process of developing this project taught me a lot about how programming languages take what the user inputs and converts it into runnable instructions. While this is
			an interpreted language, I believe I understand how these concepts can be applied to compilation.<br><br>
			Something I wish I had done differently is choosing a different language to write this in; while I enjoy programming in C, I found myself worrying about memory almost as much
			as the program's actual functionality (Side note from future me: this is not purely C's fault. I should have been smarter about creating a better memory
			interface for my needs).<br><br>
			The program takes BASIC-like code as an input and goes through three main steps to interpret their meaning:
			<ol>
				<li><b>Lexical Analysis</b>, otherwise known as tokenizing, converts the text into a series of useable types of data, including numbers, operators, and keywords.</li>
				<li><b>Parsing</b> takes these tokens and organizes them into a structured parse tree, which consists of larger nodes like expressions that then consist of subnodes
				such as numbers and operators.</li>
				<li>Finally, the <b>Interpreter</b> takes these "trees" and runs certain instructions with the given values.
			</ol>
			I would love to revisit this project in the future and add several features. First, I would like to give it some more advanced functionality, and a more complete
			syntax. Additionally, I would like to add better error messages. I would also like to attempt making a compiled language.<br><br>
			
			Source code for an example program, which lists a Fibonacci-like sequence numbers starting with A, B, A+B, ..., which can be run in the interpreter, is given below.
			
			<br><br>
			<code>
			PRINT "A's ", "value"<br>
			INPUT A<br>
			PRINT "B's ", "value"<br>
			INPUT B<br>
			PRINT "Max ", "value"<br>
			INPUT C<br>
			<br>
			PRINT A<br>
			PRINT B<br>
			LET A = A + B<br>
			LET B = A + B<br>
			<br>
			IF A < C THEN GOTO 7
			</code>
